# Inspiration
Billions of text data are ingested by various social media mechanisms e.g. Social media, Customer Reviews, Blogs and they carry an infinite possibilities of understanding
human emotions. Therefore sentiment analysis is emerging as a powerful tool for categorising peoples' reaction to certain event based on the words they choose to express
such emotions. Through this project, I tried to categorise bloggers various characteristics just from the words they choose to express.
